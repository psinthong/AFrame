# PolyFrame: A DataFrame interface for database systems

Python data exploration library that integrates a Pandas-like user experience with various database systems to provide analysts with a familiar environment while scaling out the analytical operations over a large data cluster for Big Data analysis.

**Note:** This library serves as a proof-of-concept code accompanying our research [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3476249.3476281). Not all dataframe functions are/can be implemented and fully tested. Proceed with caution.
