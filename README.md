# PolyFrame: A DataFrame interface for database systems

Python data exploration library that integrates a Pandas-like user experience with various database systems to provide analysts with a familiar environment while scaling out the analytical operations over a large data cluster for Big Data analysis.

**Note:** This library is a proof-of-concept code accompanying our research [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3476249.3476281). Not all dataframe functions are/can be implemented.

### Dependencies
* Python >= 3.3
* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
* Java >= 1.8
### Targeted Database Systems
* [AsterixDB](https://github.com/apache/asterixdb/) 
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Community Edition)
* [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) 
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 
* [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) (In progress)

Example usages of PolyFrame can be found under 'notebooks' folder.
